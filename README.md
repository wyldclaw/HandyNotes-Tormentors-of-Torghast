# HandyNotes: Tormentors of Torghast
A [HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes) plugin for the Tormentors of Torghast event in The Maw added in 9.1. This addon was inspired by [HandyNotes: Scourge Invasion of Shadowlands](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-scourge-invasion-of-shadowlands). It will add the rewards and respawn order for each tormentor to the map.

Helpful for tracking your progress on the achievement [[Minions of the Cold Dark]](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=15054/minions-of-the-cold-dark) as well as vanity drops such as the [[Chain of Bahmethra]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185973/chain-of-bahmethra) mount, the [[Amaranthine Stinger]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=186449/amaranthine-stinger) pet, the [[Semi-Permeable Gelatinous Storage Pouch]](https://www.wowhead.com/item=186560/semi-permeable-gelatinous-storage-pouch) 32 slot bag, and a variety of transmog items.

Tormentors are listed in spawn order as colored skulls. A blue skull means you still need a reward from it. The Kel'Thuzad pin shows the spawn order and shared loot drops.

## Options
* Scale icon sizes and alpha
